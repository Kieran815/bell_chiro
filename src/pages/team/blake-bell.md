Blake Bell is the owner and clinic director of Bell Chiropractic &
Pain Management. Born into chiropractic literally and figuratively
in the lower level of his fathers clinic at 3300 North Lindbergh,
healing has been ingrained into him since the very beginning.

Raised in Florissant, MO Blake graduated high school from
Hazelwood Central and went on to play DII football at Quincy University as a long snapper, wedge buster, and offensive lineman while also on a choral scholarship. Feeling that he needed a new direction he left Q.U. after a year and went on to receive his bachelor of science in healthcare management from Lindenwood University.

Currently he is enrolled at Logan University to become a doctor of
chiropractic. Blake has been the clinic director since 2010.
Blake is the executive director of <a href="http://project422.org">"The Project 4-22 Foundation"</a>
a 501(c)3 Non-profit Corp that provides life-saving education to
veterans to combat the epidemic of 22 veterans completing
suicide daily.

Blake enjoys spending his spare time with his family and friends. Most weekends you can catch him coaching numerous sports teams for his athletic organization "Pumas Athletic"which provides world class athletic training to the youth in the Florissant area. A collegiate athlete in his youth and a part of numerous championship teams, he now instills that same work ethic into the leaders of tomorrow through athletics.

"I truly love what I get to do on a daily basis. There's just something I get from being a part of the healing process that I cannot get anywhere else. I love seeing people feel better and plan to do this until the day I die. Your health is incredibly important to me and we truly value every patient that walks through our doors & trust's us to treat them. You are not just another number here, I can promise you that."

-Blake
