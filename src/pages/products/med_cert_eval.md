Owner & clinic director Blake Bell has traveled the world as an advocate of medical marijuana for patients since 2010. He was not only involved in helping write and pass Amendment 2, but he was also the first person to sign the petition that eventually became law because he was the one getting them from the printers! He was the spokesman at both the 2016 and 2018 campaign kickoffs for New Approach Missouri & if you collected signatures during either campaign he was most likely your trainer or the person who notarized your work. He is a board member of Show-Me-Cannabis among other groups.
Blake has taken numerous trips assisting and leading veterans to the Institute of Cannabis Research Conference at Colorado State University - Pueblo to teach veteran leaders how marijuana can save lives from world renowned researchers and doctors with his 501(c)3,
"The Project 4-22 Foundation". He was even featured in "High Times" magazine for his work during the 2016 campaign!

Choosing a clinic with integrity is important, which is why so many people across Missouri choose to see us at Bell Chiropractic and Pain Management.
