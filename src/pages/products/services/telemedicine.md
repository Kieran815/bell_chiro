## Frequently Asked Questions:

- **But I don't have insurance!**

  That is ok. The \$100 cost covers your entire visit.
  ​

* **How will I get my medications?**

  We call them into your local pharmacy, like normal.

* **How do I know my info is secure?**

  We use <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> which provides us with everything we need to be safe, secure, and compliant.
  ​

* **Is this legal?**

  Absolutely.
  ​

* **Why is this Useful? Give me a scenario....**

  You work a 9 to 5 job, 5 days a week and have a few kids at home.
  Taking a half or full day off work is out of the question and it's been WAY too long since you saw your Primary Care Provider for an update on your prescriptions.

  So you schedule with us for a call at 5:15.

  You leave work, get into your car, get the a/c going, take a deep breath and when the link pops up in your email you click it and right there, in the car, you can have a private visit with our doctor.

  You get all of your questions answered, you get a prescription refill sent in to your local pharmacy that you pick up on the way home and you get back to your life.
